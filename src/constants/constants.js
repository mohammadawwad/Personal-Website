    title: 'FRC Robot',
    description:"As lead programmer on FRC team 6390 Hephaestus, I was responsible for programming our robot named Kevin. Some key functionalities include vision tracking, autonomous routines, and robot subsystems such as shooting, climbing, intaking and much more. This was all done by programming a sequence of motors, servos, pneumatics, and cameras using Java as well as creating a remote controlled operating interface with a series of different controllers from Joysticks to Xbox controllers.",

    title: 'FRC Swerve Drive',
    description: "I'm proud to say I have programmed the first Swerve Drive robot in British Columbia, Canada. Programming it was extremely difficult but it has its advantages such as moving in any direction as well as rotating as it drives. This allows the robot to have a lot of movement and control and was programmed in a field oriented way since each wheel or module can move back and forward and spin clockwise and counter cloockwise infinitely.",

    title: 'Pathfinding Application',
    description: "Developed using the A* and Dijkstra algorithms to find the shortest path possible to a desired setpoint. It was developed using Java Swing with multiple GUI features. It was even expanded upon into a full scale application to develop robot coordinates which can be used to automatically create an autonomous routine which can be seen in the picture above.",

    title: 'Face And Mask Recognition',
    description: "Using Machine Learning along side Python and OpenCV I was able to develop a face recognition system that would auto detect anyone it can recognise from the pictures uploaded to the program trainer. From there I further developed it during the pandemic to recognise whether or not someone is wearing a mask which can be prove useful for enforcing specific rules and laws.",
