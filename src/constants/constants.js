    description:"As lead programmer on FRC team 6390 Hephaestus, I was reponsible for programming our robot named Kevin. Some key functionalities include vision tracking, autonomous routines, and robot subsystems such as shooting, climbing, intaking and much more. This was all done by programming a sequence of motors, servos, pnuematics, and cameras using Java as well as creating a remote controlled operating interface with series of different controllers from from Joysticks to Xbox controllers.",

    description: "Im proud to say I have programmed the first Swerve Drive robot in British Columbia, Canada. Programming it was extremely dificult but it has its advantages such as moving in any directions as well as rotating as it drives. This allows the robot o have a lot of movement and control and was programmed in a field oriented way since each wheel or module can move back and forward and spin clockwise and counter cloockwise infinitely",

It was even expanded upon into a full scale application to develop robot coordinates which can be used to automatically create an autonomous routine which can be seen in the picture above.",

From there I furthere developed it durring the pandamic to recognise whether ot not someone is wearing a mask which can be prove usefull for inforcing specific rules and laws",
