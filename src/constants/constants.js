    description: "This project aimed to create an independent AI agent capable of playing the Flappy Bird game. Leveraging reinforcement learning techniques, the AI employs a neural network to interpret real-time game states, transforming them into strategic actions. With each generation, the dataset rapidly refines, empowering the AI to consistently score high. Notably, the video showcases the evolution from a challenging initial dataset to an AI that achieves enduring success within just few generations.",
